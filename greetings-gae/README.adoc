= greetings-gae

A simple https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/java/[Google App
Engine] webapp, written in 100% https://clojure.org/[Clojure], built
with http://boot-clj.com/[Boot].

IMPORTANT: you do not need a GAE account to experiment!  The GAE SDK
contains everything you need to run webapps on the local devserver;
you only need a GAE account if you want to deploy to the production
servers.

[NOTE]
====
Use of App Engine services such as the Datastore is beyond the scope of
this example.  Its sole purpose is to demonstrate the how easy it is
to use https://github.com/migae/boot-gae[boot-gae] to get a Clojure
webapp up and running on GAE with a repl-like development environment.
====

== getting started

[source,shell]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/migae/boot-gae.git
$ cd boot-gae/tasklib
$ boot pom jar install
$ cd ../greetings-gae
$ boot gae/build
$ boot gae/run
----

WARNING: The GAE java sdk is quite large, so don't be alarmed if
`gae/build` takes a while to run the first time.

To get a repl-like dev environment, open a second terminal and start a
watcher:

[source,shell]
----
$ boot gae/watch
----

If you need to change the configuration, for example to add another
servlet, you'll have to restart the server.  Rerun `boot gae/build` to
reconfigure the webapp, then run `boot gae/run` again.

== troubleshooting

```
java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: clojure/lang/Var
```

Check `<build-root>/WEB-INF/lib` to make sure your jars are there.
You probably did not run `gae/libs`.

== the code

The App Engine functions as a servlet container (it's actually a
modified version of Jetty).  Servlet containers look on disk for
compiled byte code when they need to load a servlet.  That means a
Clojure webapp must aot-compile a servlet; usually this is done using
`gen-class` in some form.

You will notice that `gen-class` is nowhere to be found the Clojure
source code of this app.  That's because it depends on the `boot-gae`
task library, which contains a `servlets` task that uses data in
`.edn` config files to generate the appropriate `gen-class` code and
aot-compiles it at build time.  You only have to do that once, unless
you change the servlet configuration in `build.boot`.

This is of course not the only possible technique we could use to
implement servlets in Clojure.  `boot-gae` could easily be extended to
suppport alternative mechanisms, but this one seems to work pretty
well.

Once you've configured a servlet in `build.boot`, you must provide an
implementation for it.  Again there are various ways to do this; this
sample code relies on the `defservice` macro of the
https://ring-clojure.github.io/ring/ring.util.servlet.html[ring.util.servlet]
component of https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring[ring].  See the
source in `src/main/clojure/migae` for examples.

See the README for https://github.com/migae/boot-gae for more info.
